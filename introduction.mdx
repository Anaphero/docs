## How it works

Our API is capable of completing a variety of clinical and administrative tasks for healthcare clinics over the phone. We offer a catalogue of Task Definitions, each designed to complete an outbound task over the phone. Some examples include:

- Scheduling an appointment with a patient
- Sending reminders to a patient via phone call
- Collecting information from a patient
- Custom b2b phone calls to offload administrative tasks (reach out to learn more: dev@anaphero.com)

## What sets us apart?

We build voice AI tasks speecifically for healthcare organizations. That means our tools are built for healthcare workflows, healthcare technology, healthcare data standards, and safety.
