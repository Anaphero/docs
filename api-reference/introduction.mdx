## Setup your environment

This section will walk you through configuring your API key and sending your first requests.

### Set up your API key

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion icon='code' title='Sending your first request'>
    The base URL for the API is: ```https://api.anaphero.com/v1```. You can test out your connection by sending the following request:

    ```GET https://api.anaphero.com/v1/health```

    You should see a response that looks like:
    ```[200] {"message": "healthy"}```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon='key' title='Get your API key'>
    During your onboarding process, you should have received your developer API
    key via secure sharing. It should look something like this: ```prod_api_5394gcf5-77ec-4c1d-87b7-dddc75909462```

    If you do not have an API key or need help accessing
    it, please reach out to dev@anaphero.com

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon='lock' title='Using Protected Routes'>
    Most requests require you to set your authentication token in the `Authorization` header. You can do this by adding an `Authorization` header and setting the value to `Bearer <your_auth_token>`.

Here is an example of a request that will list all of the recent call records for your organization:

`GET https://api.anaphero.com/v1/call`

`Authorization: Bearer prod_api_5394gcf5-77ec-4c1d-87b7-dddc75909462`
