## Setup your development environment

This section will walk you through configuring your API key and triggering your first task.

### Set up your API key

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon='key' title='Get your API key'>
    During your onboarding process, you should have received your developer API
    key via secure sharing. It should look something like this: ```5394ecf5-77ec-4c1d-87b7-dddc75909462```

    If you do not have an API key or need help accessing
    it, please reach out to dev@anaphero.com

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon='code' title='Sending your first request'>
    The base URL for the API is: ```https://api.anaphero.com/api/v1```

    For all requests, you must add an Authorization header with a bearer token in the format ```Bearer <yourApiKey>```. Once you've set your header, you can test a GET request to our ```/health``` endpoint to test your connection like this:

    ```GET https://api.anaphero.com/api/v1/health```

    You should see a response that looks like:
    ```[200] {"message": "healthy"}```

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Getting a phone number

This section will talk you through how to list your organization's available phone numbers. These are the numbers you may use to trigger outbound phone calls.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon='phone' title='Listing all phone numbers'>
  During your onboarding process, we will have configured phone numbers that are
  available for your use. You can list your available phone numbers with this
  request: 
  
  ```GET https://api.anaphero.com/api/v1/phone-number```

You should see a response that looks like:

`[{"phoneNumberId": "bfc1153b-975b-43da-ada8-5176abd2d012", "number": "+18847362873", "telephonyProvider": "twilio"}, ...]`

Note the `id` of the phone number you wish to use--this is what you will use in your next request to tell the API to use this number.

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

### Create your first call

Now you're ready to trigger your first call! We are going to start by triggering a call to remind a patient that they have an appointment coming up.

We are going to use a hypothetical patient, `John Smith`, and a hypothetical appointment on `Monday, July 15th at 10am` for an `Annual Wellness Exam` with `Dr. Emily Turner` at `123 N Main St.`.

For now, use your own phone number for the `destinationPhoneNumber` parameter so you can receive the call.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon='square-plus' title='Creating the call'>
  A reminder call can be scheduled for `John Smith` with the following request:

```
POST http://api.anaphero.com/v1/call
{
  "taskId": "98975fc0-b219-4599-b1b8-1138bd15309a",
  "sourcePhoneNumberId": "<phoneNumberId you retrieved above>",
  "destinationPhoneNumber": "<your phone number>",
  "taskParameters": {
    "patientName": "John Smith",
    "appointmentDate": "2024-07-15T10:00:00Z",
    "appointmentType": "Annual Wellness Exam",
    "provider": "Dr. Emily Turner",
    "address": "123 N Main St."
  }
}
```

</Accordion>
<Accordion icon='check' title='Receive the call'>
  You should receive a phone call to you. Pretend to be John Smith as you interact with the voice AI. 
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon='clipboard' title='View the result'>
  You can view the result of the call by making the following request:

```
GET http://api.anaphero.com/v1/call/{callId}
```

</Accordion>
